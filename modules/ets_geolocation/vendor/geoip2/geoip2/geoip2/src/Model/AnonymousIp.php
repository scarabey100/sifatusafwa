 * This class provides the GeoIP2 Anonymous IP model.
 *
 * @property bool $isAnonymous This is true if the IP address belongs to
 *                             any sort of anonymous network.
 * @property bool $isAnonymousVpn This is true if the IP address is
 *                                registered to an anonymous VPN provider. If a VPN provider does not
 *                                register subnets under names associated with them, we will likely only
 *                                flag their IP ranges using the isHostingProvider property.
 * @property bool $isHostingProvider This is true if the IP address belongs
 *                                   to a hosting or VPN provider (see description of isAnonymousVpn property).
 * @property bool $isPublicProxy This is true if the IP address belongs to
 *                               a public proxy.
 * @property bool $isTorExitNode This is true if the IP address is a Tor
 *                               exit node.
 * @property string $ipAddress The IP address that the data in the model is
 *                             for.
 * @property string $network The network in CIDR notation associated with
 *                           the record. In particular, this is the largest network where all of the
 *                           fields besides $ipAddress have the same value.
